VapeCraft is a Minecraft mod I am working on that allows players to build their own juuls.
Features I have now: create juul, juul pods, and take fatty rips. You can also mine nic salt from the
ground.
I want to add tobacco farms and more complex crafting recipes. I also want to add an addiction mode
so that you'll literally die if you don't juul enough.
